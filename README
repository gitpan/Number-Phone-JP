Number::Phone::JP version 0.01
==============================

Number::Phone::JP is a simple module to validate Japanese phone number
formats. The Japanese phone numbers are regulated by Ministry of Public
Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications of Japan. You can
validate what a target number is valid from this regulation point of
view.

There are many categories for type of telephones in Japan. This module
is able to be used narrowed down to the type of phones.

This module only validates what a phone number agrees on the regulation.
Therefore, it does NOT validate what a phone number actually exists.

This validation needs only an area (or category) prefix and behind it.
The separator of number behind the prefix is ignored.
